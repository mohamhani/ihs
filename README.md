This solution is written in C++.

I have used Visual Studio Code as my code editor, and GNU C++ Compiler (g++) as my compiler.

Guidance on how to run the program:

There are two methods of running this program.

1: You can download any editor of your choice, and GNU C++ Compiler to compile this program.

2: Alternatively, an easier method is to copy-paste the program into the online gdp C++ Compiler and then
   hit the green run button on the top left corner.
